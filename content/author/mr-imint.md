_Mr. IMINT_ is a small shareholder of Imint AB. He lives in Oslo, Norway, and has no current or prior connection to Imint AB. _Mr. IMINT_ was probably the first to find proof about Huawei being the first smartphone customer of Vidhance products [(source)](https://www.avanza.se/placera/forum/trad.1775.2700806.html), which led to Imint AB [disclosing the customer](https://press.aktietorget.se/ImintImageIntelligence/81808/617501.pdf). 

_Mr. IMINT_ still does a lot of analysis of smartphone firmware's that might be related to Imint AB, but is also interested in all other aspects of Imint AB.
