# About Huawei

[Huawei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei) is today the worlds biggest providers of telecommunication equipment. They are also the third biggest smartphone manufacturer selling [139.3 million units in 2016](http://consumer.huawei.com/en/press/news/2017/hw-u-035103/).

# History

With Mate 9 Huawei was the first device maker to launch a phone with Vidhance Video Stabilization. The launch was preceded by a [SEK 800 thousand integration contract](http://imint.se/nyheter/20160506-imint-tecknat-utvecklingsavtal-videostabilisering/) followed by an announcement of a [license agreement](http://imint.se/nyheter/20161026-imint-tecknar-licensavtal/). Huawei was never mentioned by name and that was still the case when Imint proudly proclaimed that [there was a phone on the market that used Vidance](http://imint.se/nyheter/20170110-videostabilisering-i-smartphone-pa-marknaden/). Only after [Mr Imint](/author/mr-imint) and others had found traces of Vidhance in the Mate 9 firmware leading to a half day halt in trading did Imint [confirm it](http://imint.se/nyheter/20170123-vidhance-videostabilisering-huaweimate9/). Since then Imint has not been able to confirm the existence of Vidhance in any Huawei device.

Reliable availability of firmware images from Huawei's own update service has delivered the necessary raw data to verify the existance of the Vidhance software in
all premium models ever since. For non-premium models Huawei has so far continued to use video stabilization from Morpho.

# Devices

Today the existence of Vidhance software is verified in the following phones:
