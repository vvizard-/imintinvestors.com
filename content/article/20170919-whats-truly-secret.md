title: What's Truly Secret?
author: Simon Mika

There has been a lot of discussions and opinions on what and when Imint chooses to disclose information. Imint has so far not published a ocmmunication strategy so this article will mostly be based on speculative conclusions drawn from what they have decided to actually talk about.

# The Secrets
Let us start by looking at what is true secrets. Information that would hurt Imint if it got out. We can divide this into two categories:

- Imints secrets
- Imints customers secrets

## Imints Secrects
The are three things Imint needs to keep secret:

- How it works
- Prices
- Future products

### How It Works
The long term most important secret is how Imint's products work. Not what they achieve but how they achiieve it. This is the basis of Imint's competitive advantage. These secrets can be protected either by keeping it secret or by patenting parts. As patenting a technology requires you to publicly describe what you are patenting a patent actually often ends up describing the "secret". Patents are therefore suitable when how to build it is obvious from having one item. This is seldom the case when it comes to software. Therefore it can be wise not to use patents but rather keep the details of how a certain acomplishment is achieved secret. Imint uses a combination of patents and "secrets" to secure their intellectual property.

### Prices
The costs of putting a feature in a unit for Imint comes down to two things:

- Inventing and implementing the feature.
- Integrating and adapting the feature into the device model.

The first cost is shared among all devices and models that use the feature. The second is cost is shared among all units that are sold of the particular model. Sometimes it can even be shared among several related models. Imint can get the best price by charging it's customrs per sold unit since that's how Imints customers get paid. But as Imints customers also know that Imint does not have any costs per unit they are able to get a price that depends on:

- Predicted sales volumes.
- Percieved reference value.
- Future value of customer.

At least the percieved reference value of a customer is something Imint would not like it other customers to know.

It shall also be noted that Imint has communicated that they are trying to differntiate their products into subproducts. When it comes to stabilization it can be assumed that the actual price also will depend on:

- Resolution supported.
- Support for using it together with OIS.
- Support for removing more in-frame distortions.

> A secret pricing model enabels Imint to maximize the profit of each deal.

Exactly how Imint chooses to differentiate a product family might actually depend on the precieved needs of the customer.

With a secret pricing model Imint is able to maximize the profit of each deal. The difference in pricing is likely at least several hundered precent. If customers knew about the pricing other customers had they would be in a stronger negotiating postion then they are today.

This is why it is in Imints and therefore also in Imints shareholders interest to keep everything related to pricing a secret:

- Unit prices at certain volumes.
- Sales volumes (as total revenue must be disclosed).

### Future Products
Imint has not been especially tightlipped about what new products they are working on. This can however change as the more details they release ahead of product launch to end users the harder it will get for competitors to keep up. As Imint gets more successful and their competitors start to pay more attention it is likely that Imint will get more tightlipped about future products.

## Imints Customers Secrets
As a part of the sales and integration process Imint will also get knowledge of some of their customers secrets. The, in this case most relevant ones are:

- The fact that they consider using Imints products.
- Which Vidhance features they end up using.
- That they use Vidhance.
- Release dates.
- Sales predictions.
- Actual sales.

Some of these Imint might actually not know and are also likely changed and updated regulary. Others, like the usage of Vidhance in a model, might at some point after release not be a secrete but that does not mean that the customers wants it to be a general knowledge among their consumers as that will make it harder for them to switch away from using Vidhance in the future and therefore strengthen Imints negotiation position.

### Sales Volumes
Device makers tend to publish shipped units. I think they sometimes even call it sold units even if they just sold them to a reseller and the reseller has a credit for at least part of the price until they actually sell it to a consumer. Imint often gets payed after the consumer buys the device. Therefore the actual numbers Imint gets paid for during a quarter might differ quite a bit from the number of units Imints customers claim to have shipped. This inventory in the sales channel however helps Imint to keep its sales quantities and therefore average unit prices secret.

### Obstacles to Confirming Public Information
In general it is often not advicable for Imint to publicly disclose these things even after the customer has been open about it. It can be asumed in some cases that for Imint to use the customers brands in a press release, the customer needs to agree on the wording. Public relations in these companies is often handled at a quite high level getting such an aproval can take quite some time and effort when done outside the context of a newly signed agreement.

### Release Dates
Add to this the fact that Imint probably often does not know the exact release dates and sometimes might not even know for sure which models contain Vidhance before the customer starts reporting sales. It is also hard of Imint to keep track of whether or not a customer has officially verified if a device contains Vidhance. These things can together explain why Imint is so unwilling too do press releases upon realeses of new models by existing customers.

### Conclusion
> It is many times not feasable for Imint to publicly confirm already publicly known information about its customers.

Imint can many times benefit from that information secret to their customers become public as long as Imint has no part in its disclosure. It it also many times not feasable for Imint to publicly confirm information about its customers that already have become public.

# The Unknowns
Predicting Imints future is really hard. Not only for us on the outside but also for the company themselves. Although they do internal guesses of the future and even set up future goals, they so far have been reluctant to communicate them publicly. Given the amount of uncertainty it is realy easy to be either over optimistic or way to pessimistic. However they guess the market would many times punish the stock. This is why the current strategy of not to communicating any predictions of the future might be the best. Not only for the company but also for us as long term shareholders as well.

# The Current Situation
We currently have a situation where the shareholders are starved for information and therefore put a lot of weight into every detail they can get hold of. This in combination with the fact that many shareholders are quite unfamiliar with how a business like Imints works has lead to overreactions in the market. It has also resulted in a hunt for information not limted to massive amount of questions to Imint but also the quest to scrape other sources for available information. On example of this is to use Andreas (CEO) wifes Facebook page to find out if he is traveling. All with the hope that travels might be correlated to positive press releases. This thirst for information among the shareholders together with overreactions to the information that actually have been given have probably lead to a situation where Imints representatives are very carefull about what they say and how they say it.

The problem is that this starves the shareholders even more and it feeds the vicious spiral. Imint needs to do the analysis of what it actually needs to keep secret and what not. Given that analysis it needs to start talking about everything that it can talk about. Even if they deam that information not to be strictly relevant for investors. This is the only way out of the current situation.

> Many of Imints shareholders are also Imints fans.

In many ways Imint does not have regular investors. Many of the investors don't only hope for a good return on investment they are also in love with Imints current and future products. Imint has somewhat by mistake succeeded in something most companies only can dream of. Many of Imints shareholders are also Imints fans. To keep their interest up Imint needs to feed them information and positive messages on a frequent and regular basis. This is of course quite some work but if Imint does this right they can also gain some benefits. Among these are:

- Help recruiting and informing new shareholders.
- Create buzz around devices with Vidhance.
- Help analyzing competitiors quality and market penetration.

Hopefully Imint can soon dedicate some attention to its fans and start gaining the benefits.
